# Invest With Ease

## Overview
**Invest With Ease** is a stock forecasting web application that provides investors with AI-powered insights for making informed investment decisions. The platform integrates two key machine learning models:

1. **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Model** - Generates Buy/Sell signals for an equity share based on historical stock price data.
2. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model** - Predicts stock prices seven days ahead using time series forecasting.

The application is built using **Streamlit**, allowing for an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning-Based Trading**: Utilizes OpenAI's Gym and FinRL to train an AI agent to make stock trading decisions.
- **LSTM-Based Stock Forecasting**: Implements an LSTM model to predict future stock prices for top-traded stocks in **NIFTY50**.
- **Technical Indicators**: Uses MACD, RSI, CCI, DX, and Relative Strength for analysis.
- **Interactive UI**: Provides a dashboard for investors to visualize trends, trading signals, and price forecasts.

## Methodology

### Reinforcement Learning Model
The DRL-based trading model utilizes an AI agent trained with reinforcement learning techniques to optimize stock trading strategies.
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance API
- **Frameworks**: FinRL, OpenAI Gym, Stable Baselines3
- **Workflow**:
  1. Load and preprocess stock market data.
  2. Train an RL agent to execute buy/sell actions.
  3. Evaluate performance using backtesting techniques.

### LSTM Model
The LSTM-based price prediction model forecasts stock prices using historical trends.
- **Architecture**: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM cells.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Collect stock price data.
  2. Train an LSTM model for time series forecasting.
  3. Predict stock prices for the next seven days.

### Web Application
- Built using **Streamlit**.
- Provides an easy-to-use interface for stock analysis.
- Allows users to:
  - View daily trading actions from the RL model.
  - Analyze seven-day stock price predictions.
  - Compare historical vs. predicted stock prices.
